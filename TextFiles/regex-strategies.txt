Some useful regex commands for cleaning up the txt files and preparing them for conversion to HTML:


Remove newlines from inside paragraphs - [a-zA-Z.,):â€“?-]\n[^\s]
	- This looks for characters that precede newlines (\n) which are not then followed by whitespace characters (which they would in the case of end-of-paragraphs where we do not want to get rid of the newline)
	- What we want to do here is basically go in and replace all of the \n characters that lie within paragraphs and replace them with spaces. 

Remove newlines from inside paragraphs that are apart of indented quote blocks - [^\n]\n\t
